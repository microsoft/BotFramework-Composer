# Bot Framework Composer Extensions

It is possible to extend and customize the behavior of Composer by installing extensions.
Extensions can hook into the internal mechanisms of Composer and change they way they operate.
Extensions can also "listen to" the activity inside Composer and react to it.

## What is a Composer extension?

Composer extensions are Javascript modules. When loaded into Composer, the module is given access
to a set of Composer APIs which can then be used by the extension to provide new functionality to the application.
Extensions do not have access to the entire Composer application - in fact, they are granted limited access
to specific areas of the application, and must adhere to a set of interfaces and protocols.

## Extension Endpoints

Extensions currently have access to the following functional areas:

- Authentication and identity - extensions can provide a mechanism to gate access to the application, as well as mechanisms used to provide user identity.
- Storage - extensions can override the built in filesystem storage with a new way to read, write and access bot projects.
- Web server - extensions can add additional web routes to Composer's web server instance.
- Publishing - extensions can add publishing mechanisms
- Runtime Templates - extensions can provide a runtime template used when "ejecting" from Composer
- Bot Project Templates - extensions can add items to the template list shown in the "new bot" flow
- Boilerplate Content - extensions can provide content copied into all bot projects (such as a readme file or helper scripts)

Combining these endpoints, it is possible to achieve scenarios such as:

- Store content in a database
- Require login via AAD or any other oauth provider
- Create a custom login screen
- Require login via Github, and use Github credentials to store content in a Git repo automatically
- Use AAD roles to gate access to content
- Publish content to external services such as remote runtimes, content repositories, testing systems, etc.

## How to build an extension

Extension modules must come in one of the following forms:

- Default export is a function that accepts the Composer extension API
- Default export is an object that includes an `initialize` function that accepts the Composer extension API
- A function called `initialize` is exported from the module

Currently, extensions can be loaded into Composer using 1 of 2 methods:

- The extension is placed in the /extensions/ folder
- The extension is installed via the extensions page

The simplest form of a extension module is below:

```ts
export default async (composer: ExtensionRegistration): Promise<void> => {
  // call methods (see below) on the composer API
  // composer.useStorage(...);
  // composer.usePassportStrategy(...);
  // composer.addWebRoute(...)
};
```

### Authentication and identity

To provide auth and identity services, Composer has in large part adopted [PassportJS](http://www.passportjs.org) instead of implementing a custom solution.
Extensions can use one of the [many existing Passport strategies](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/), or provide a custom strategy.

#### `composer.usePassportStrategy(strategy)`

Configure a Passport strategy to be used by Composer. This is the equivalent of calling `app.use(passportStrategy)` on an Express app. [See PassportJS docs](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/configure/).

In addition to configuring the strategy, extensions will also need to use `composer.addWebRoute` to expose login, logout and other related routes to the browser.

Calling this method also enables a basic auth middleware that is responsible for gating access to URLs, as well as a simple user serializer/deserializer. Developers may choose to override these components using the methods below.

#### `composer.useAuthMiddleware(middleware)`

Provide a custom middleware for testing the authentication status of a user. This will override the built-in auth middleware that is enabled by default when calling `usePassportStrategy()`.

Developers may choose to override this middleware for various reasons, such as:

- Apply different access rules based on URL
- Do something more than check `req.isAuthenticated` such as validate or refresh tokens, make database calls, provide telemetry, etc

#### `composer.useUserSerializers(serialize, deserialize)`

Provide custom serialize and deserialize functions for storing and retrieving the user profile and identity information in the Composer session.

By default, the entire user profile is serialized to JSON and stored in the session. If this is not desirable, extensions should override these methods and provide alternate methods.

For example, the below code demonstrates storing only the user ID in the session during serialization, and the use of a database to load the full profile out of a database using that id during deserialization.

```ts
const serializeUser = function (user, done) {
  done(null, user.id);
};

const deserializeUser = function (id, done) {
  User.findById(id, function (err, user) {
    done(err, user);
  });
};

composer.useUserSerializers(serializeUser, deserializeUser);
```

#### `composer.addAllowedUrl(url)`

Allow access to `url` without authentication. `url` can be an express-style route with wildcards (`/auth/:stuff` or `/auth(.*)`)

This is primarily for use with authentication-related URLs. While `/login` is allowed by default, any other URL involved in auth needs to be whitelisted.

For example, when using oauth, there is a secondary URL for receiving the auth callback. This has to be whitelisted, otherwise access will be denied to the callback URL and it will fail.

```ts
// define a callback url
composer.addWebRoute("get", "/oauth/callback", someFunction);

// whitelist the callback
composer.addAllowedUrl("/oauth/callback");
```

#### `plugLoader.loginUri`

This value is used by the built-in authentication middleware to redirect the user to the login page. By default, it is set to '/login' but it can be reset by changing this member value.

Note that if you specify an alternate URI for the login page, you must use `addAllowedUrl` to whitelist it.

#### ExtensionContext.getUserFromRequest(req)`

This is a static method on the ExtensionContext class that extracts the user identity information provided by Passport.
This is for use in the web route implementations to get user and provide it to other components of Composer.

For example:

```ts
const RequestHandlerX = async (req, res) => {
  const user = await ExtensionContext.getUserFromRequest(req);

  // ... do some stuff
};
```

### Storage

By default, Composer reads and writes assets to the local filesystem. Extensions may override this behavior by providing a custom implementation of the `IFileStorage` interface. [See interface definition here](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Composer/blob/stable/Composer/packages/server/src/models/storage/interface.ts)

Though this interface is modeled after a filesystem interaction, the implementation of these methods does not require using the filesystem, or a direct implementation of folder and path structure. However, the implementation must respect that structure and respond in the expected ways -- ie, the `glob` method must treat path patterns the same way the filesystem glob would.

#### `composer.useStorage(customStorageClass)`

Provide an iFileStorage-compatible class to Composer.

The constructor of the class will receive 2 parameters: a StorageConnection configuration, pulled from Composer's global configuration (currently data.json), and a user identity object, as provided by any configured authentication extension.

The current behavior of Composer is to instantiate a new instance of the storage accessor class each time it is used. As a result, caution must be taken not to undertake expensive operations each time. For example, if a database connection is required, the connection might be implemented as a static member of the class, inside the extension's init code and made accessible within the extension module's scope.

The user identity provided by a configured authentication extension can be used for purposes such as:

- provide a personalized view of the content
- gate access to content based on identity
- create an audit log of changes

If an authentication extension is not configured, or the user is not logged in, the user identity will be `undefined`.

The class is expected to be in the form:

```ts
class CustomStorage implements IFileStorage {
  constructor(conn: StorageConnection, user?: UserIdentity) {
    ...
  }

  ...
}
```

### Web Server

Extensions can add routes and middlewares to the Express instance.

These routes are responsible for providing all necessary dependent assets such as browser javascript, css, etc.

Custom routes are not rendered inside the front-end React application, and currently have no access to that application. They are independent pages -- though nothing prevents them from making calls to the Composer server APIs.

#### `composer.addWebRoute(method, url, callbackOrMiddleware, callback)`

This is equivalent to using `app.get()` or `app.post()`. A simple route definition receives 3 parameters - the method, url and handler callback.

If a route-specific middleware is necessary, it should be specified as the 3rd parameter, making the handler callback the 4th.

Signature for callbacks is `(req, res) => {}`

Signature for middleware is `(req, res, next) => {}`

For example:

```ts
// simple route
composer.addWebRoute("get", "/hello", (req, res) => {
  res.send("HELLO WORLD!");
});

// route with custom middleware
composer.addWebRoute(
  "get",
  "/logout",
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.warn("user is logging out!");
    next();
  },
  (req, res) => {
    req.logout();
    res.redirect("/login");
  }
);
```

#### `composer.addWebMiddleware(middleware)`

Bind an additional custom middleware to the web server. Middleware applied this way will be applied to all routes.

Signature for middleware is `(req, res, next) => {}`

For middleware dealing with authentication, extensions must use `useAuthMiddleware()` as otherwise the built-in auth middleware will still be in place.

### Publishing

#### `composer.addPublishMethod(publishMechanism, schema, instructions)`

By default, the publish method will use the name and description from the package.json file. However, you may provide a customized name:

```ts
composer.addPublishMethod(
  publishMechanism,
  schema,
  instructions,
  customDisplayName,
  customDisplayDescription
);
```

Provide a new mechanism by which a bot project is transferred from Composer to some external service. The mechanisms can use whatever method necessary to process and transmit the bot project to the desired external service, though it must use a standard signature for the methods.

In most cases, the extension itself does NOT include the configuration information required to communicate with the external service. Configuration is provided by the Composer application at invocation time.

Once registered as an available method, users can configure specific target instances of that method on a per-bot basis. For example, a user may install a "Publish to PVA" extension, which implements the necessary protocols for publishing to PVA. Then, in order to actually perform a publish, they would configure an instance of this mechanism, "Publish to HR Bot Production Slot" that includes the necessary configuration information.

Publishing extensions support the following features:

- publish - given a bot project, publish it. Required.
- getStatus - get the status of the most recent publish. Optional.
- getHistory - get a list of historical publish actions. Optional.
- rollback - roll back to a previous publish (as provided by getHistory). Optional.

##### publish(config, project, metadata, user)

This method is responsible for publishing the `project` using the provided `config` using whatever method the extension is implementing - for example, publish to Azure. This method is _required_ for all publishing extensions.

In order to publish a project, this method must perform any necessary actions such as:

- The LUIS lubuild process
- Calling the appropriate runtime `buildDeploy` method
- Doing the actual deploy operation

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Description
|-- |--
| config | an object containing information from the publishing profile, as well as the bot's settings -- see below
| project | an object representing the bot project
| metadata | any comment passed by the user during publishing
| user | a user object if one has been provided by an authentication extension

Config will include:

```ts
{
  templatePath: '/path/to/runtime/code',
  fullSettings: {
    // all of the bot's settings from project.settings, but also including sensitive keys managed in-app.
    // this should be used instead of project.settings which may be incomplete
  },
  profileName: 'name of publishing profile',
  ... // All fields from the publishing profile
}
```

The project will include:

```ts
{
  id: 'bot id',
  dataDir: '/path/to/bot/project',
  files: // A map of files including the name, path and content
  settings: {
    // content of settings/appsettings.json
  }
}
```

Below is an simplified implementation of this process:

```ts
const publish = async (config, project, metadata, user) => {
  const { fullSettings, profileName } = config;

  // Prepare a copy of the project to build

  // Run the lubuild process

  // Run the runtime.buildDeploy process

  // Now do the final actual deploy somehow...
};
```

##### getStatus(config, project, user)

This method is used to check for the status of the most recent publish of `project` to a given publishing profile defined by the `config` field. This method is _required_ for all publishing extensions.

This endpoint uses a subset of HTTP status codes to report the status of the deploy:

| Status | Meaning                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| 200    | Publish completed successfully |
| 202    | Publish is underway            |
| 404    | No publish found               |
| 500    | Publish failed                 |

`config` will be in the form below. `config.profileName` can be used to identify the publishing profile being queried.

```ts
{
  profileName: `name of the publishing profile`,
  ... // all fields from the publishing profile
}
```

Should return an object in the form:

```ts
{
  status: [200|202|404|500],
  result: {
    message: 'Status message to be displayed in publishing UI',
    log: 'any log output from the process so far',
    comment: 'the user specified comment associated with the publish',
    endpointURL: 'URL to running bot for use with Emulator as appropriate',
    id: 'a unique identifier of this published version',
  }
}
```

##### getHistory(config, project, user)

This method is used to request a history of publish actions from a given `project` to a given publishing profile defined by the `config` field. This is an _optional_ feature - publishing extensions may exclude this functionality if it is not supported.

`config` will be in the form below. `config.profileName` can be used to identify the publishing profile being queried.

```ts
{
  profileName: `name of the publishing profile`,
  ... // all fields from the publishing profile
}
```

Should return in array containing recent publish actions along with their status and log output.

```ts
[
  {
    status: [200 | 202 | 404 | 500],
    result: {
      message: "Status message to be displayed in publishing UI",
      log: "any log output from the process so far",
      comment: "the user specified comment associated with the publish",
      id: "a unique identifier of this published version",
    },
  },
];
```

##### rollback(config, project, rollbackToVersion, user)

This method is used to request a rollback _in the deployed environment_ to a previously published version. This DOES NOT affect the local version of the project. This is an _optional_ feature - publishing extensions may exclude this functionality if it is not supported.

`config` will be in the form below. `config.profileName` can be used to identify the publishing profile being queried.

```ts
{
  profileName: `name of the publishing profile`,
  ... // all fields from the publishing profile
}
```

`rollbackToVersion` will contain a version ID as found in the results from `getHistory`.

Rollback should respond using the same format as `publish` or `getStatus` and should result in a new publishing task:

```ts
{
  status: [200|202|404|500],
  result: {
    message: 'Status message to be displayed in publishing UI',
    log: 'any log output from the process so far',
    comment: 'the user specified comment associated with the publish',
    endpointURL: 'URL to running bot for use with Emulator as appropriate',
    id: 'a unique identifier of this published version',
  }
}
```

### Runtime Templates

#### `composer.addRuntimeTemplate(templateInfo)`

Expose a runtime template to the Composer UI. Registered templates will become available in the "Runtime settings" tab.
When selected, the full content of the `path` will be copied into the project's `runtime` folder. Then, when a user clicks
`Start Bot`, the `startCommand` will be executed. The expected result is that a bot application launches and is made available
to communicate with the Bot Framework Emulator.

```ts
await composer.addRuntimeTemplate({
  key: "myUniqueKey",
  name: "My Runtime",
  path: __dirname + "/path/to/runtime/template/code",
  startCommand: "dotnet run",
  build: async (runtimePath, project) => {
    // implement necessary actions that must happen before project can be run
  },
  buildDeploy: async (runtimePath, project, settings, publishProfileName) => {
    // implement necessary actions that must happen before project can be deployed to azure

    return pathToBuildArtifacts;
  },
});
```

##### build(runtimePath, project)

Perform any necessary steps required before the runtime can be executed from inside Composer when a user clicks the "Start Bot" button. Note this method _should not_ actually start the runtime directly - only perform the build steps.

For example, this would be used to call `dotnet build` in the runtime folder in order to build the application.

##### buildDeploy (runtimePath, project, settings, publishProfileName)

| parameter          | description                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| runtimePath        | the path to the runtime that needs to be built                      |
| project            | a bot project record                                                |
| settings           | a full set of settings to be used by the built runtime              |
| publishProfileName | the name of the publishing profile that is the target of this build |

Perform any necessary steps required to prepare the runtime code to be deployed. This method should return a path to the build artifacts with the expectation that the publisher can perform a deploy of those artifacts "as is" and have them run successfully. To do this it should:

- Perform any necessary build steps
- Install dependencies
- Write `settings` to the appropriate location and format

#### `composer.getRuntimeByProject(project)`

Returns a reference to the appropriate runtime template based on the project's settings.

```ts
// load the appropriate runtime config
const runtime = composer.getRuntimeByProject(project);

// run the build step from the runtime, passing in the project as a parameter
await runtime.build(project.dataDir, project);
```

#### `composer.getRuntime(type)`

Get a runtime template by its key.

```ts
const dotnetRuntime = composer.getRuntime("csharp-azurewebapp");
```

### Bot Project Templates

Add a project template to the list available during the bot creation process. Extensions can bundle arbitrary bundle of content that will be copied into the bot project at create time. The template should contain a functioning bot project, along with any specializations and configuration defaults required to successfully run the project.

#### `composer.addBotTemplate(template)`

```ts
await composer.addBotTemplate({
  id: 'name.my.template.bot'
  name: 'Display Name',
  description: 'Long description';
  path: '/path/to/template'
});
```

In addition, boilerplate material will also be added to every new bot project. Extensions can bundle additional content that will be copied into every project, regardless of which template is used.

#### `composer.addBaseTemplate(template)`

```ts
await composer.addBaseTemplate({
  id: 'name.my.template.bot'
  name: 'Display Name',
  description: 'Long description';
  path: '/path/to/template'
});
```

### Accessors

`composer.passport`

`composer.name`

## Extension Roadmap

These features are not currently implemented, but are planned for the near future:

- Eventing - extensions will be able to emit events as well as respond to events emitted by other extensions and by Composer core.

- Front-end extensions - extensions will be able to provide React components that are inserted into the React application at various endpoints.

- Schema extensions - Extensions will be able to amend or update the schema.
