## API spec

### FileSystem API
FileSystem api allows you to management multiple storages and perform file-based on top of them.  


#### storage

`storage` is a top-level resource which follows the common pattern of a REST api. 

`GET api/storages` list storages

by default return 
```
{
    id: "default"
    name: "This pc",
    type: "LocalDrive",
    path: "storage path"
}
```

`POST api/storages` create storage

```
{
    name: "MyStorage"
    type: "AzureBlob",
    url: "http://xxx.blob.net",
    container: "/bots",
    key: "******"
}
```

`DELETE api/storages` delete storage


#### blob
blobs is a sub-resouce of storage, but it's not refered by ID, it's refer by path, because we are building a unified file api interface, not targeting a specific clound storage (which always have id for any item).  

`GET api/storages/{storageId}/blobs/{path}` list dir or get file

this `path` is an absolute path for now

Sample 
```
GET api/storage/default/c:/bots

{
    name: "bots",
    parent: "c:/",
    foolderTree: 
    {
        folders:[
        {
            name: "config",
            parent: "bots",
        }],
        files:[{
            name: "a.png"
            parent: "bots",
            lastModified: 201231290, // ms since epoch
            size: 20kb
        }]
    }
}

GET api/storage/default/c:/bots/a.bot 

{
   entry: "main.dialog"
   ……
}


```

```
