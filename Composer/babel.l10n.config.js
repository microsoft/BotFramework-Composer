// TODO: It would be nice to use the regular expression matching.
// It would be nice to ignore the lib folders rather than listing them one at a time.
// However, as of 4/2021 it doesn't seem to work.
// We have the added complexity that packages/lib contains folders we DO want to process.
//
// /packages\/(?!lib$).+\/lib(\/.*)*/
// This was the negative lookahead regex I tried, but bable never seemed to honor.
// I verified this regex had the right behavior in a regex tester with many path variations.
