# Composer - Recommended OS versions

The tables below provide recommended OS information for Composer 1.3 and later.

For this release, the Composer application will **only run on x64**. We will support more architectures in upcoming releases.

You can continue to publish your bot to a 32-bit platform (for instance on an Azure Web Application B1 tier).

If you are using Orchestrator, you will need to run on an x64 platform. Please read [this document](preview%20features/orchestrator.md)
