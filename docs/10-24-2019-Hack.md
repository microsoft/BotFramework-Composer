- Or create your own bot using Composer
- [Deploy](#Deploy-a-bot) a bot from Composer

### Use latest Structured LG
- The BF SDK includes the Language Generation library to create sophisticated responses. The .lg files help describe language generation templates with entity references and their composition. .lg files are markdown based with  additional syntax and semantics only where needed. Read more about [.lg file format](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/vishwac/master-4.6/experimental/language-generation/docs/lg-file-format.md)

- LG now [support structured response tempaltes](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/vishwac/master-4.6/experimental/language-generation/docs/structured-response-template.md), which enable you to define a complex structure that supports all the goodness of LG (templating, composition, substitution) while leaving the interpretation of the structured response up to the caller of the LG library.
