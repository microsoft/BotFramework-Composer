# Enabling a connection to Direct Line Speech

Once the Speech connection has been enabled in Bot Framework Composer, or via the Azure portal, there are a few additional steps required to get your bot connected.

Pre-requisites: Before you can connect a bot to Speech, be sure you've completed the following actions:

* You've built a basic bot in Composer
* You've created a publishing profile and published your bot to Azure
* You've [created a Cognitive Services key](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne)
* You've enabled the Speech connection in your bot's settings

To verify your connection to the Speech service, [follow the instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-directlinespeech?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#example).
