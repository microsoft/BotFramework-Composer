# Enabling a connection to Web Chat

Once the web chat connection has been enabled in Bot Framework Composer, or via the Azure portal, there are a few additional steps required to get your bot connected.

Pre-requisites: Before you can connect to your bot with web chat, be sure you've completed the following actions:

* You've built a basic bot in Composer
* You've created a publishing profile and published your bot to Azure
* You've enabled the web chat connection in your bot's settings
