# Sending responses with cards 

A bot communicates with users through message activites which are multi-modal. There are messages which simply consist of plain text and there are also richer message content such as cards. Bot Framework Composer supports [structured response template](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/vishwac/master-4.6/experimental/language-generation/docs/structured-response-template.md) with which you can add rich cards to your bot and enhance yor bot's design. If you are looking for examples about sending text messages to users please read the [sending messages to users](./howto-sending-messages.md) article. 

In this article, we will cover different types of cards you can define in Composer using [structured response template](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/master/experimental/language-generation/docs/structured-response-template.md). We use the examples provided in the [RespondingWithCardsSample](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Composer/tree/master/Composer/packages/server/assets/projects/RespondingWithCardsSample) throughout this article. 

## Card types

Composer currently supports the following types of rich cards. The definition and use of each type of the cards is provided in the [RespondingWithCardsSample](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Composer/tree/master/Composer/packages/server/assets/projects/RespondingWithCardsSample). 

| Card type | Description |
|------|------|
| Hero Card | A card that typically contains a single large image, one or more buttons, and simple text. |
| Thumbnail Card | A card that typically contains a single thumbnail image, one or more buttons, and simple text.| 
| Signin Card | A card that enables a bot to request that a user sign-in. It typically contains text and one or more buttons that the user can click to initiate the sign-in process.| 
| Animation Card | A card that can play animated GIFs or short videos. |
| Voice Card | A card that can play a voice file. |
| Audio Card | A card that can play an audio file. |
| Adaptive Card | A customizable card that can contain any combination of text, speech, images, buttons, and input fields. |

## Structured response template 

In Composer we use [structured response template](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/vishwac/master-4.6/experimental/language-generation/docs/structured-response-template.md) to define the cards you want to send back to users. To get yourself familiar with the structured LG template, it is recommended that you read the [language generation](./concept-language-genereation-draft.md) concept article and the [structured response template](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/vishwac/master-4.6/experimental/language-generation/docs/structured-response-template.md) article. 

A typical structured response template for cards consists of the following parts: 

    # CardTemplateName 
    [CardStructure-name
        title = title of the card
        subtitle = subtitle of the card
        text = description of the card
        image = url of your image
        buttons = name of the button you want to show in the card]

| Template Component    | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| # CardTemplateName | Name of the structured card template starting with "#".  |
| [   ] | A pair of square brackets to wrap the content of the structure.   |
| CardStructure-name  | Name of the structure.|
| title | A title of the defined template such as "BotFramework Hero Card". |
| subtitle | A subtitle of the defined template such as "Microsoft Bot Framework". |
| text |A brief description of the template. | 
| image |The url of your image. | 
| buttons |Name of the button you want to show in the card. |

## Define rich cards 
Now, let's walk through the card examples in the [RespondingWithCardsSample](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Composer/tree/master/Composer/packages/server/assets/projects/RespondingWithCardsSample) and learn how each type of the cards are defined and used. 

### HeroCard
A Hero card is a basic card type that allows you to combine images, text and interactive elements such as buttons in one object and present a mixture of them to the user. A HeroCard is defined using structured template as follows: 

    # HeroCard
    [HeroCard
        title = BotFramework Hero Card
        subtitle = Microsoft Bot Framework
        text = Build and connect intelligent bots to interact with your users naturally wherever they are, from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services.
        image = https://sec.ch9.ms/ch9/7ff5/e07cfef0-aa3b-40bb-9baa-7c9ef8ff7ff5/buildreactionbotframework_960.jpg
        buttons = {cardActionTemplate('imBack', 'Show more cards', 'Show more cards')}]

This example of hero card will enable your bot to send an image from a designated url back to users when an event to send a hero card is triggered. The hero card will include a button to show more cards when pressed. 

### ThumbnailCard
A Thumbnail card is another type of basic card type that combines a mixture of images, text and buttons. Unlike Hero cards which present designated images in a large banner, Thumbnail cards present images as thumbnail. It is card that typically contains a single thumbnail image, one or more buttons, and simple text. A ThumbnailCard is defined using structured template as follows: 

    # ThumbnailCard
    [ThumbnailCard
        title = BotFramework Thumbnail Card
        subtitle = Microsoft Bot Framework
        text = Build and connect intelligent bots to interact with your users naturally wherever they are, from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services.
        image = https://sec.ch9.ms/ch9/7ff5/e07cfef0-aa3b-40bb-9baa-7c9ef8ff7ff5/buildreactionbotframework_960.jpg
        buttons = Get Started]

### SigninCard
A Signin card is a card that enables a bot to request that a user sign in. A SinginCard is defined using structured template as follows: 

    # SigninCard
    [SigninCard
        text = BotFramework Sign-in Card
        buttons = Sign-in]

### AnimationCard
Animation cards contain animated image content (such as `.gif`). Typically this content does not contain sound, and is typically presented with minimal transport controls (e.g, pause/play) or no transport controls at all. Animation cards follow all shared rules defined for ort controls (e.g. rewind/restart/pause/play). Video cards follow all shared rules defined for [Media cards](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/master/specs/botframework-activity/botframework-cards.md#Media-cards). An AnimationCard is defined using structured template as follows: 

    # AnimationCard
    [AnimationCard
        title = Microsoft Bot Framework
        subtitle = Animation Card
        image = https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/media/how-it-works/architecture-resize.png
        media = http://i.giphy.com/Ki55RUbOV5njy.gif]

### VideoCard
Video cards contain video content in video format such as `.mp4`. Typically this content is presented to the user with advanced transport controls (e.g. rewind/restart/pause/play). Video cards follow all shared rules defined for [Media cards](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/master/specs/botframework-activity/botframework-cards.md#Media-cards). A VideoCard is defined using structured template as follows: 

    # VideoCard
    [VideoCard
        title = Big Buck Bunny
        subtitle = by the Blender Institute
        text = Big Buck Bunny (code-named Peach) is a short computer-animated comedy film by the Blender Institute
        image = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Big_buck_bunny_poster_big.jpg/220px-Big_buck_bunny_poster_big.jpg
        media = http://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/BigBuckBunny_320x180.mp4
        buttons = Learn More]

### AudioCard

Audio cards contain audio content in audio format such as `.mp3`  and `.wav`. Audio cards follow all shared rules defined for [Media cards](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/master/specs/botframework-activity/botframework-cards.md#Media-cards). An AudioCard is defined using structured template as follows: 

    # AudioCard
    [AudioCard
        title = I am your father
        subtitle = Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
        text = The Empire Strikes Back (also known as Star Wars: Episode V â€“ The Empire Strikes Back)
        image = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3c/SW_-_Empire_Strikes_Back.jpg
        media = http://www.wavlist.com/movies/004/father.wav
        buttons = Read More]

### AdaptiveCard
Adaptive cards is an open source toolset of Microsoft that helps apps and services exchage rich snippets of native UI. Card authors describe their content as a simple JSON object. That content can then be rendered natively inside a host application, automatically adapting to the look and feel of the host. To get an overview of adaptive cards please visit [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/). An AdaptiveCard is defined using structured template as follows: 

    # AdaptiveCard
    [Activity
        Attachments = {json(adaptivecardjson())}
    ]

### AllCards 
This template "#AllCards" is defined to display all cards when the template is called. 

    # AllCards
    [Activity
        Attachments = {HeroCard()} | {ThumbnailCard()} | {SigninCard()} | {AnimationCard()} | {VideoCard()} | {AudioCard()} | {AdaptiveCard()}
        AttachmentLayout = {AttachmentLayoutType()}
    ]
