- choose the Echo Bot template
- give your bot a name and optional discription and create your bot.


### Test your bot
To test a bot from Composer, you need to ensure the Bot Project is running. If you are using dockers to run Composer you are good. If you are building and running Composer yourself (using Yarn), you will need to run the bot project manually.

> Note: only if not running Composer using docker. 
Open a new terminal window. Navigate to the Bot Framework Composer repo. In the repo, navigate to the **BotProject\csharp** folder. Run the following command:
```
dotnet run
```
This will build and run a Bot Framework bot that the Composer connects to.

The bot is running on http://localhost:3979/api/messages.

To test your bot, in the Composer app, click on the Connect button (top right).

<p align="center">
    <img alt="Bot Framework Composer Home Page" src="./Assets/Connect-1.jpg" style="max-width:700px;" />
</p>

You should see the Connect button changes to Reload and a link to Test in Emulator. Click on it to launch the emulator.

<p align="center">
    <img alt="test in emulator" src="./Assets/test-1.jpg" style="max-width:700px;" />
</p>

The emulator automatically connects to your bot. You can now interact with your bot.

Now they would like to support online delivery for their customers. Considering the competitive online delivery market, the company needs your help to build a bot to meet the challenge. 
Your task: Build a bot for PizzaCom, so that their customers can order pizza through the bot. 
  

**Scenario 2: Reminder Bot**
