# multi-turn prompt

This sample demonstrates using [Adaptive dialog][1] and [Language Generation][2] PREVIEW features to achieve the same functionality that the waterfall based cards sample [here][3].

This sample uses preview packages available on the [BotBuilder MyGet feed][4].

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to use the prompts classes included in `botbuilder-dialogs`.  This bot will ask for the user's name and age, then store the responses. It demonstrates a multi-turn dialog flow using a text prompt, a number prompt, and state accessors to store and retrieve values.
