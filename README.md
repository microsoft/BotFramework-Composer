## Overview 
 
Bot Framework Composer is an integrated development tool for developers and multi-disciplinary team of professional conversation designers for building bots and other types of conversational software with the Microsoft Bot Framework technology stack. Within this web-based tool, you'll find everything you need to build a modern, state-of-the-art conversational experience. 
- A visual editing canvas for conversation flows
- In context editing for language understanding (NLU) 
- Tools to train, test and manage language understanding (NLU) and QnA components
- Language generation and templating system
- A ready-to-use bot runtime executable

Bot Framework Composer, an open source tool, enables teams working to create bots to build all kinds of conversational experiences that use the latest features from the [Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework). The Composer app reads and writes from the [Adaptive Dialog](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/experimental/adaptive-dialog) format, a [declarative](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/experimental/adaptive-dialog/declarative) JSON specification shared by many tools provided by the Bot Framework. Dialogs, NLU training data and message templates are treated like normal developer assets - files that can be committed to source control and deployed alongside code updates.
