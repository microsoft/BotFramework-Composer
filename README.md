## Overview

Bot Framework Composer is an open-source, visual authoring canvas for developers and multi-disciplinary teams to design and build conversational experiences with Language Understanding and QnA Maker, and a sophisticated composition of bot replies (Language Generation). Within this tool, you'll have everything you need to build a sophisticated conversational experience.

- A visual editing canvas for conversation flows
- In context editing for language understanding (NLU)
- Tools to train, test and manage language understanding (NLU) and QnA components
- Language generation and templating system
- A ready-to-use bot runtime executable

The Bot Framework Composer is an open source tool based on the Bot Framework SDK. It is available as a [desktop application](#get-started) as well as a [web-based component](#build-composer-locally)
